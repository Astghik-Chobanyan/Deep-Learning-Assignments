## Deep Learning Assignments

### Overview

Welcome to the `Deep-Learning-Assignments` repository! This repository is a 
collection of assignments from a Deep Learning course.

### Contents

This repository is organized into the following directories, each containing a specific project:

1. **LinearApproximationAnalysis/**:
   - Focuses on the linear approximation of the function âˆš1 + x, offering a deep dive into different linear regression techniques and their comparative analysis.
   - Contains the notebook `LinearRegressionComparisons.ipynb`.

2. **HeartDiseasePrediction/**:
   - Aims at predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using logistic regression and neural networks, emphasizing data preprocessing, model optimization, and comparative analysis.
   - Contains the notebook `HeartDiseaseClassifier.ipynb`.

### Usage

To make the most out of this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific directory of interest (`LinearApproximationAnalysis` or `HeartDiseasePrediction`).
3. Open the corresponding `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or any environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks.
4. Run the cells sequentially to understand the methodology, implementation, and analysis.
