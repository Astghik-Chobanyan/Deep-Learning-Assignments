## Heart Disease Prediction

### Overview

The `HeartDiseasePrediction` directory is dedicated to the development and comparison of various machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. This project is part of a Deep Learning course curriculum, emphasizing not only the implementation of predictive models but also the preprocessing and optimization techniques in machine learning workflows.

### File Structure

- `HeartDiseaseClassifier.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook is the core of the project, encompassing data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and result evaluation.

### Project Details

The `HeartDiseaseClassifier.ipynb` notebook is meticulously structured to guide you through the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Importing the dataset.
    - Splitting the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

2. **Model Implementation and Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - **Logistic Regression**: Implement logistic regression using scikit-learn and tune hyperparameters.
    - **Normalization**: Apply standard normalization to the dataset and observe the impact on logistic regression performance.
    - **Neural Network**: Develop a neural network with no more than two hidden layers to address the same prediction task.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate and compare the accuracy of the logistic regression model and the neural network, both before and after data normalization.
    - Discuss the impact of normalization on model performance.
